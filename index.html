        <p id="slogan">Be a Programmer. Don't be idle!</p>
    </h1>
    <p>Programming and hacking had become a thing that if you lack in these present times, you're really lacking 
        something huge. Though people see it somekind of weird or scary, but actually its a fun and very very cool
    to be a <strong>Programmer</strong> or an <strong>Ethical hacker</strong>. Some people also with the knowledge are you kind
of lemming <i>scamming or frauding</i> people with this knowledge.
No don't ever do it. Don't be in a rush to learn so that you can do same but be in a rush to learn so that you can 
be your own <strong>BOSS</strong>.
The pretty cool I like about programming is how the magic happens when you write some <em>words.</em> 
Well enough of the talking and let's get started.</p>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Cyber Programmer</strong> and welcome to my website. I develop this website or site for absolute
          beginners and also professions. To  more about this site visit the <a href="#about" style="text-decoration: none; color:blue;">about page.</a>

            <p><abbr title="Structured Query Language" style="text-decoration: underline;
                text-decoration-color: red; cursor: pointer;">SQL</abbr> is a computer language for storing, manupulating and retieveing data stored

We can also say that is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), 
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

                <p>SQL became the standard of the <abbr title="American National Standard Institute " ><strong style="text-decoration: underline;

                1986, and of the <strong>International Organization Standardization </strong>(ISO) in 1987.
